# icon-visualization-examples

To illustrate to new users of ICON what pre-processing and visualization
pipeline is typical for ICON simulations. We use an R2B7 upper atmosphere
simulation as an exemplary case.

```
/work/bm1233/m300685/UAICON/R2B7_free_30_years
```

To demonstrate the pipeline, you can call/inspect the script

```
python scripts/basic_zonal_wind_contour.py
```

The associated contour plot is in the `data/` directory.
